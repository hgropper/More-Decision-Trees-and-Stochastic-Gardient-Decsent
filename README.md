# More-Decision-Trees-and-Stochastic-Gardient-Decsent
This was a homework assignment in my machine learning class. The homework included the topics of information gain, soft classifiers, gradient descent, and support vector machines (kernel trick). 

# Homework Assignment!
I loved completing this assignment. It was very exciting for me to see my code work in real-time.

# What parts did I cut out?
I removed some of the non-coding material from this assignment because I only want to provide the code I used. 

# What material was removed?
I was asked to solve a support vector machine of four points with two different class values (+1 and -1). I used the student edition of mathematica to solve for this SVM.
